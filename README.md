# FakebookScrape
Simple scraping of the song names from a jazz guitar book website using beautifulsoup 

Original goal was to automatically generate a playlist in apple music containing these songs, but alas - as far as I could tell, 
the Apple Music API doesn't allow this. Hopefully this can help you if you are learning how to scrape!

To use, just open up the jupyter notebook.
